You are an expert in TypeScript, Node.js, Next.js 16 App Router, React, Shadcn UI, Radix UI, Tailwind, Drizzle ORM, IndexedDB, and drag-and-drop libraries.

## Code Style and Structure

- Write concise, technical TypeScript code with accurate examples.
- Use functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid classes.
- Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication.
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading, hasError, isSyncing, isPending).
- Structure files: exported component, subcomponents, helpers, static content, types.

## Naming Conventions

- Use lowercase with dashes for directories (e.g., components/todo-list, lib/db, components/drag-drop).
- Favor named exports for components.

## TypeScript Usage

- Use TypeScript for all code; prefer interfaces over types.
- Avoid enums; use maps instead.
- Use functional components with TypeScript interfaces.
- Define interfaces for all entities: User, Project, Todo (matching IndexedDB and Drizzle schemas).

## Syntax and Formatting

- Use the "function" keyword for pure functions.
- Avoid unnecessary curly braces in conditionals; use concise syntax for simple statements.
- Use declarative JSX.

## UI and Styling

- Use Shadcn UI, Radix, and Tailwind for components and styling.
- Implement responsive design with Tailwind CSS; use a mobile-first approach.

## Performance Optimization

- Minimize 'use client', 'useEffect', and 'setState'; favor React Server Components (RSC).
- Wrap client components in Suspense with fallback.
- Use dynamic loading for non-critical components.
- Optimize images: use WebP format, include size data, implement lazy loading.
- Batch IndexedDB queries to minimize operations.

## Key Conventions

- Use 'nuqs' for URL search parameter state management.
- Optimize Web Vitals (LCP, CLS, FID).
- Limit 'use client':
  - Favor server components and Next.js SSR.
  - Use only for Web API access in small components.
  - Use for IndexedDB operations, drag-and-drop interactivity, and sync detection.
  - Avoid for data fetching or state management when possible.

## Offline-First & Sync

- All client changes save to IndexedDB first with `syncStatus: 'pending'`.
- Use `lib/db/indexeddb.ts` for all local storage operations.
- Implement conflict resolution using `updatedAt` timestamps (last-write-wins).
- Mark items as `syncStatus: 'synced'` after successful server sync.
- Always include error handling for IndexedDB and sync failures.
- Detect online/offline status and trigger sync automatically.

## Database & ORM

- Use Drizzle ORM for all PostgreSQL operations via Neon.
- Keep schema in `lib/db/schema.ts` with sync fields: `syncStatus`, `localId`, `isDeleted`, `updatedAt`.
- Run migrations with `pnpm db:push`.
- Include `userId` on todos and projects for querying and permissions.

## Drag & Drop

- Implement drag-and-drop for organizing todos between projects.
- Update `updatedAt` when items are reordered.
- Ensure drag-and-drop works offline and syncs changes on reconnect.

## PWA & App Features

- Include manifest.json for PWA installation.
- Add service worker for offline support.
- Ensure app works on desktop and mobile devices.
- Optional authentication for multi-device sync or database persistence.

## API Routes

- Keep routes in `app/api/` organized by resource (projects, todos, sync).
- Validate all incoming data.
- Return consistent JSON responses.
